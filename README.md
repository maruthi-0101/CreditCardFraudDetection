# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project leverages machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time. It involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and the deployment of a Flask API for live predictions.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Credit card fraud is a major challenge in the financial industry. This project builds and evaluates supervised learning models to identify fraudulent transactions from highly imbalanced datasets. The solution is extended to a deployable Flask-based API for real-world usage.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Exploratory data analysis and class imbalance handling
- Model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Model evaluation using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC
- Flask API for real-time fraud prediction
